# Challenge

We are given a binary to exploit. By running `checksec` on it, we see that the binary has the following protections:
[show-line-numbers]: false
```Plaintext
Canary                        : No
NX                            : Yes
PIE                           : Yes
Fortify                       : No
RelRO                         : Partial
```

Because the binary has NX, we cannot place executable shell code in a buffer and then jump to it. PIE allows the code 
section of the binary to be located anywhere in memory. This means that we don't know the address of functions within 
the binary; however, we still know relative offsets.


## Reverse Engineering

We can see that `argv[1]` is copied into a 0x100 byte buffer on the stack. However, there are no checks on the size of `argv[1]`. This is plainly a stack overflow vulnerability. 

## Exploit

Now that we have an understanding of what the binary does, we can construct a payload to get code execution. Since the canary is not enabled, we can overwrite the return address. However, because of PIE and ASLR, we don't have any clear targets to jump to.


### Where do we jump?

The binary is dynamically linked and uses the system libc. We can find targets within the binary, when jumped to, result in a call to `execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL)` and lead to "a shell".  The tool [one_gadget](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget) finds offsets to these one gadgets within a given libc binary. Running `one_gadget libc.so.6` gives the following output:

![](5df7042c0898260951d4389c.png)


However, we don't know the base address that libc is loaded at.


### How?

Generally, the libc runtime handles initializes itself before calling `main`. This means that when `main` returns, we end up within libc. In fact, in this [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/JRs1KT1HQCoDUSDAmW1r6CCcC), we see that `main` returns to `__libc_start_main` within libc. 

If we overflow the buffer, we can overwrite this address. We could overwrite the entire return pointer, but what if we only overwrote it partially? This is known as a partial overwrite. Since all functions within libc have the same base address, we can overwrite the lower bytes of the return pointer to jump to any known offset within libc.

### One small problem

When `strcpy` is called, it adds a null byte to the end of the destination buffer. If we attempt a partial overwrite, this will result `0x00` being placed within the return pointer.

To overcome this, we can bruteforce ASLR by repeatedly running the program until libc is loaded in a position that matches the overwritten return pointer. We need to bruteforce 1.5 bytes (because the one_gadget is `4f2c5`, we only need to bruteforce the upper half of `0x?4` and the null byte before it). This means that, on average, we will need to execute the program `4096` times before successfully reaching a shell.
